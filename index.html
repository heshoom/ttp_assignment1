    <h1>Empowering College Students' Mental Health</h1>
    <h2>Supporting Mental Health of College Students</h2>
    <!-- Mission statement or introductory text -->
    <p class="justified-text">At the heart of our cause is the recognition that college students across the nation face
      immense mental health challenges. We aim to shed light on the often invisible struggles they endure, from academic
      pressures and financial burdens to social isolation and anxiety disorders. By fostering awareness and
      understanding, we strive to create a supportive environment that nurtures the emotional well-being of these young
      individuals. Together, we can make a lasting impact on their lives, empowering them to thrive academically,
      emotionally, and socially.</p>
